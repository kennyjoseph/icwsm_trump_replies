# Intro
This is the repository for code for the following paper. If you use the tools we've created, please cite our paper!


# Details

There are two files in this repository. 

The first shows how we generated results for our first research question (```rq1_analyses.R```). 

The second is a jupyter notebook (with an ```R``` kernel), ```rq2_analysis.ipynb``` that shows our analyses for our second research question.

# Data Availability

Given the potentially revealing nature of our data, we have restrictions on our ability to share it. Specifically:

- We cannot share any of the data on the panel of Twitter users linked to voter records
- For the scraped reply data from the simulated accounts, data *is* available, but only upon request (and in an anonymized fashion!)

# Looking for the scraping tools?

See Zijian's code [here](https://github.com/zijianan/twitter_screen_scrape)!
